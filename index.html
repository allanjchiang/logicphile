                At Logicphile, we create beautiful productivity apps on Android and iOS. Apps that will change the way you work. 
                Our first project will be a simple to-do list. Later, we will expand it to include apps like Forest where instead
                of planting trees, we will be creating stars. Galaxies. Superclusters. Everything to do with space. You name it. 
                We'll do it.

            <h2>What makes us different?</h2>
            <p class="about">
                Have you ever wanted to study or work but weren't sure as to how much time you had exactly? What if you set a timer for 30 minutes
                but then had something urgent come up at 20 minutes? In traditional productivity apps, that meant you had to terminate your progress--
                withering your tree. Or cheat and let the timer keep running until it was over. What if instead of setting a timer, you could set a
                stopwatch instead? That way, you could stop it whenever you want, you'd feel like you earned that time spent and you wouldn't neet to
                worry about any of that stuff. No withering or cheating required.
